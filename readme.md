# Welcome to the OVOS Skills Store!

This is OpenVoiceOS' Skill Store, where OVOS community developers can submit their skills. It's also where the OVOS dev team hosts our own skills!

setting up your own marketplace is as easy as forking this repository!

## Submitting a skill

Submitting a Skill is easy, and relatively painless, though a few steps need to be completed before your Skill can be accepted:

1. You must create a JSON file for your Skill. Learn more about the [skill.json specification](https://openvoiceos.github.io/ovos-technical-manual/skill_json/)

2. Your skill must be licensed under an OSI-approved open-source license, or released into the public domain, except by special permission from the OVOS dev team. Such permission is unlikely to be granted except in cases where your Skill integrates Mycroft or OVOS with software that is a) extremely valuable to users, b) extremely popular, c) privacy-respecting, and d) cannot be integrated any other way. (We're talking about things like a big-name streaming service, or integrating with a video game console. Big things with no open-source alternative. Submissions containing utility Skills under a proprietary license will be summarily closed as invalid.)

Once you have completed these steps, you can create a pull request to this repository, adding your JSON file. Your Skill will be reviewed as soon as possible by one or more OVOS developers or authorized Skill Reviewers.

Once your Skill has been reviewed, and the pull request is merged, your Skill should immediately be listed on the OVOS Skills Store!
